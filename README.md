Course Overview

An introduction to concepts and application of machine learning algorithms and
techniques. Machine learning is an active and growing field that would require
many courses to cover completely. This course aims at the middle of the
theoretical versus practical spectrum. We will learn the theoretical concepts
behind several types of machine learning algorithms and gain practical
experience applying them.
